This repository provides a simple **.bat (batch) file** that enables the **Group Policy Editor (gpedit.msc)** on Windows 10 Home. By default, Windows 10 Home does not include the Local Group Policy Editor, as it is only available in **Pro, Enterprise, and Education** editions.  

## üîß How It Works  
The batch file **installs the necessary policy editor components**, allowing users to access **gpedit.msc** on unsupported editions of Windows.  

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes  
- **Use at your own risk!** We are not responsible for any issues that may arise from using this script.  
- **Run as Administrator** to ensure it executes correctly.  
- **Allow through your firewall or antivirus** if necessary, as some security software might block batch file execution. A certificate would cost a lot to ensure the validity of the software is safe, so please press `Run Anyways` if it comes up with Smart Screen prompts.

## üöÄ Getting Started  
1. **Download the .bat file** from this repository.  
2. **Right-click & Run as Administrator.**  
3. **Wait for the process to complete** and restart your computer if needed.  
4. **Press `Win + R` and type `gpedit.msc`** to open the Group Policy Editor.
